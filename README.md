# Systematic analysis of current steering in subthalamic deep brain stimulation in Parkinson’s Disease

## Abstract

**Background:** Directional deep brain stimulation (DBS) allows for steering of the stimulation field. Currently, it is
unclear which patients profit from directional current steering.

**Objective/Hypothesis:** The goal of the study was to investigate in a standardized, systematic manner whether
directional DBS of the STN provides an increased Therapeutic Window , and to predict which contacts should be
selected for directional testing.

**Methods:** 52 Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with a directional DBS
system (Boston Scientific model DB-2202) underwent a standardized programming session 5-9 months after
implantation. The recorded Effect Threshold , Side Effect Threshold and Therapeutic Window were tested for
potential benefit of current steering and used to build a prediction model for the selection of the contacts profiting
from horizontal steering.

**Results:** According to our standardized protocol, 66% of patients had a larger Therapeutic Window on directional
stimulation compared to ring-mode, whereas on average no difference in Therapeutic Window between ring-level
and best directional contact was noticed. We were able to predict which contacts should be retested in a directional
manner with a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 57%.

**Conclusion:** Our results confirm the directionality of the system. According to our analysis, additional directional
testing should be done in ring-level contacts with a Therapeutic Window <2.0mA.
