# Deep-Brain-Stimulation: when to go directional?

## Abstract

**Background:** Directional deep brain stimulation (DBS) allows for steering of the stimulation field, but it is currently unclear in which cases directional current steering might offer an advantage. Furthermore, extensive and time–consuming testing of all segmented contacts is necessary to identify the possible benefit of steering.

**Objective:** The goal of the study was to investigate in a standardized, systematic manner whether directional DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) provides an increased Therapeutic Window compared to ring level stimulation and to predict which contacts should be selected for directional testing.

**Methods:** 52 Parkinson’s disease patients implanted in the STN with a directional DBS system (Boston Scientific model DB-2202) underwent a standardized monopolar programming session 5-9 months after implantation. Individual contacts were tested for a potential advantage of directional stimulation. Subsequently obtained results were used to build a prediction model for the selection of ring levels that would benefit from directional stimulation.

**Results:** According to our standardized protocol, 35% of the contacts and 66% of patients had a larger Therapeutic Window on directional stimulation compared to ring-mode, whereas on average no difference in Therapeutic Window between ring-level and best directional contact could be determined. The segmented contacts that should further be explored could be predicted with a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 57%.

**Conclusion:** According to our analysis, we recommend performing additional directional testing in ringlevel contacts with a Therapeutic Window of less than 2.0 mA. Using this algorithm, the time spent on DBS programming can be significantly reduced.
